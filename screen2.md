# SnapWeather - Il fait beau l√†-haut

## The Phone App you need 

In this app, many functionalities can be accessed from the home page. When you open it from your phone, you will see a **worldmap**. In this map, your added friends will be disposed if their location is activated. You just have to click on their avatar and their picture of the weather will appear. From that, you can send them emojis, a fun message or you can even invite them to become your "friend" on the app. 

## Public or private 
You can chose to put your avatar on public mode or private mode. If it's in private mode, only your friends will be able to see your posted pictures but if it's public mode, every person using the app will be able to see it. 

 ## Travel the world with your phone 
You can travel the world and make new friends. Or just check your real life friends' weather to know if you want to visit them or not.
